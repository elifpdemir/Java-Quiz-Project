# Java Quiz Project

This project is a simple quiz simulator I created to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java and to improve my skills in reading from and writing to files. My goal was to build something that is functional, easy to understand, and useful for anyone who wants to practice.

## What does it do?

- Loads questions and answers from a `.txt` file
- Generates random math questions with a timer
- Measures how long it takes to answer each question
- Shows the number of correct and incorrect answers at the end along with the total time spent

## What I used while building this project

- Core concepts of OOP in Java (classes, methods, encapsulation, etc.)
- How to read data from a file using `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`
- How to measure time using `System.currentTimeMillis()`
- How to structure a Java project
- Writing cleaner and more readable code
